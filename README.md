# GitHub Repository Description for OCR Notebook
## Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with TrOCR: A Comprehensive Guide
### Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing a complete Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline using the Transformer-based TrOCR model developed by Microsoft. The notebook is structured to guide users through various critical stages of OCR, including data preparation, bounding box generation, image preprocessing, dataset creation, and model training and evaluation.

### Features
Data Preparation: Scripts to load and preprocess image data, including reading images, generating bounding boxes from CSV files, and handling image directories.
Bounding Box Generation: Utilizes OpenCV and Pandas to read images and corresponding CSV files to extract bounding box coordinates for text in images.
Cropping and Saving Images: Code to crop images based on bounding box coordinates and save them for training and testing, including handling of exceptions.
Defective Image Detection: Functionality to identify and exclude defective or unreadable images from the dataset.
Custom Dataset Creation: Scripts to create custom PyTorch datasets compatible with TrOCR, including data loading and preprocessing for model input.
Model Training Setup: In-depth setup for training the TrOCR model, including data loaders, model configuration, and training loop.
Performance Metrics: Implementation of Character Error Rate (CER) metric for evaluating model performance.
Unused Utility Functions: Additional scripts that might be useful for different OCR tasks or data preparation methods.
### Technologies Used
Python Libraries: Pandas, OpenCV, PIL, PyTorch, Transformers, Datasets
Model: Microsoft's TrOCR (Transformer-based OCR)
### How to Use
Clone the repository.
Ensure all dependencies are installed (see requirements.txt).
Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train, and evaluate the OCR model.
### Note
This notebook is intended for educational purposes and serves as a comprehensive guide for those interested in OCR using deep learning, specifically with the TrOCR model. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing an OCR pipeline from scratch.
